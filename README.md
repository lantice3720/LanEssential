# LanEssential
Core System of LANSERVER

This is a minecraft plugin for paper 1.17.1 server.
This plugin has many features, but many bugs too.
It's on alpha, so it could be unstable.
<br/>**NOT FOR LAN SERVER! THIS PLUGIN IS FOR PAPER SERVER!**

## Features

### Custom NPC
Wow! Without ProtocolLib!

You can add your own npc by command. But we don't have npc actions yet :(

### Edit Item
Easy and Cool

You can merge item's name, lore, custom-model-data, etc.
Well, not that stable but cool ;)

### Mana System
Wingardium Leviosa!

This plugin adds mana system based on chunk.
Players have their own mana, and can charge them through drinking mana potion or extracting from chunk!
